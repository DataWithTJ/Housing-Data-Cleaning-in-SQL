# Housing-Data-Cleaning-in-SQL
n this data cleaning project, I refined a Nashville housing dataset. Key tasks included standardizing addresses, correcting dates, removing duplicates, normalizing 'LandUse' and 'SalePrice', and using imputation and exclusion for missing values. The aim was preparing the data for effective predictive modeling and trend analysis.
